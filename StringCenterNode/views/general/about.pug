        h1(align='center') About StringCenter
        p StringCenter is a social media application that is centered around music, specifically guitars. StringCenter
            |  also allows users to do all of the expected social media activities, post to their page,
            | create a public page or group, post to a group, follow others, look at other’s posts, get their news
            | feed, etc. The difference with StringCenter, is that we created an in app ability to create guitar
            | tabs on the fly, giving users a space to document the music they’ve learned and created. On the
            | flipside, the user can search through all of the tabs ever created by the community, by name, allowing
            | users to search up a song they want to learn and have the tab for it at their fingertips.

        p The community aspect of StringCenter is a huge focus, hoping to give users a chance to follow topics
            | they are interested in. Right when the user logs in they will see their newsfeed, with the latest
            | posts from both the users and the groups that they follow. In turn, they can also direct posts to a group,
            | spreading their post, and potentially their tab, to everyone in the group.

        p StringCenter features a mobile app using Dart and the Flutter
            | framework, providing us with the ability to run the same code on
            | both Android and IOS devices. On the backend, we created a REST API with
            | Node.js and the Express framework, utilizing JSONWebToken authentication.
            | We used the MongoDB database with the Mongoose ORM library, providing a
            | fairly simple NOSQL way to query the needed data. A web based client is
            | currently being developed with the AngularJS framework.
